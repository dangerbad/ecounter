Frequency counter with external 8bit prescale counter.

This is an avr project wrote in c for the gnu-avrlibc cross compiler. While I
may get a schematic uploaded, in the mean time the pinout is listed in
"pins.txt".

The purpose of putting this in a public repo was to shame myself into
finishing the project and makeing it sorta documented and nice.
